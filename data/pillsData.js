    text: "The Diamond Sutra says, 'The past is ungraspable, the present is ungraspable, the future is ungraspable.' So all of us in this room; where are we? Are we in the past? No. Are we in the future? No. Are we in the present? No, we can't even say we're in the present. There's nothing we can point to and say, 'This is the present,' no boundary lines that define the present. All we can say is, 'We are this very moment.' And because there's no way of measuring it, defining it, pinning it down, even seeing what is is, it's immeasurable, boundless, infinite. It's what we are.",

    text: "Being selfish and having a desire to be unselfish are both based on fear. Even the desire to be wise, to be perfect, is based on fear. We wouldn't chase the desire if we saw we were already free. So our practice always comes back to the same thing: how to see more clearly, how not to go down blind alleys, such as that of trying to be unselfish.",
